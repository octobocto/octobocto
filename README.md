I went from being a bad coder to being a decent coder after
working hard at it for 5 years. 'Decent coder' doesn't sound
that impressive, but keep in mind I'm bad at whoring myself
out.

I'll let you be the judge instead by telling you what I've made. Not keen to read about it? Skip to [technologies I know](#all-achievements).

I started my journey of becoming decent by making a React Native
app where you can [buy, sell and send bitcoin](https://bitgate.io/en/).

Next I got more serious by joining a bitcoin-only shop and
developed a trustless bitcoin payment processor. Think OpenNode,
but you run it yourself. It's closed source, but luckily I made a
[npm package](https://github.com/arcanetechnology/npm-teslacoil)
before I quit. Two days before bitcoin topped out in 2021 I was
feeling rich and started my own company with a good friend.

Now I found myself going full circle by making an app where you can
[buy, sell and send bitcoin](https://barebitcoin.no). But this time I
owned the company. Turns out it takes a long time to get regulatory
approval for a bitcoin exchange, so while waiting I **added lightning
to a crypto exchange with 150k+ users**. In bold because I think
that's pretty cool. (This is the point where I started calling myself
a decent coder) After adding lightning, I swapped out their hot-wallet
with Fireblocks.

All the projects above had just two people writing code. And guess
what? We're **available for hire**. I promise we've become quite
effective at cooperating since 2018.

## All achievements
- Made a trustless bitcoin payment processor that hedged all the bitcoin it sent/received.
- Integrated lightning for an exchange with 150k+ users.
- Swapped out the same exchanges hot-wallet with Fireblocks.
