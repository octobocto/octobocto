Co-founder @ [Bare Bitcoin](https://barebitcoin.no), a bitcoin-only broker targeting Norway.

### Other coding ventures
- I made a React Native app where Norwegians could buy, sell and send bitcoin,
- a self-custodial bitcoin payment processor. Think OpenNode, but you run it yourself.
- **Integrated lightning for an exchange with 150k+ users.**, and
- swapped out the same exchanges hot-wallet with Fireblocks.
