### What I've coded
- A React Native app where you can buy, sell and send bitcoin.
- A self-custodial bitcoin payment processor. Think OpenNode, but you run it yourself.
- **Integrated lightning for an exchange with 150k+ users.**
- Swapped out the same exchanges hot-wallet with Fireblocks.
- Made a bitcoin broker neatly packaged into a SwiftUI app.

All the projects had just two people writing code. And guess
what? We're **available for hire**. I promise we've become quite
effective at cooperating since 2018.
